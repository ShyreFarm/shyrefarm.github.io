This was my second attempt at a whelping box:

I went to Lowe's to purchase new materials for this one, but still tried to keep the cost low.  It's made from a single 4x8 sheet of painted high density MDF and a few 8ft 2x2's.  The pig rail is from 2" PVC pipe.  For storage, around 12 key screws are taken out, and the walls nest into each other.  The step-through has slots in the sides that allow a panel to slide in.

But still, there are some flaws:

* Dismantling and reassembly is tedious with the screws, even with a power drill.
* The nested walls are compact but difficult to carry and keep nested.
* The bottom edges of the MDF deterriorate over time from the cleaning sprays and the nearby blankets getting wet (these are puppies after all!).
* The 4-8 week puppies aren't able to step through the step-through!
