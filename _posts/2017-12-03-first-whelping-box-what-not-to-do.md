title: First whelping box (what not to do)

This was my first attempt at building a whelping box many years ago:

The walls were made of particle board from an old wardrobe closet.  The floor and pig rails were particle board as well.  The boards were screwed to 2x2 wood pieces aligned vertically in the corners.

The smooth laminate on the particle board was good for wiping clean, however the edges of the boards were not laminated and the edges began to deteriorate after multiple daily wipe downs.  Other than that, the structure held up well for a couple litters.  That is, except for the pig rails.  The adult dog tended to lean and sit on these, so having screws only along one edge of the board proved to be far too weak.

Another drawback we quickly discovered as the puppies grew bigger was that the step-through wall was not tall enough to contain the puppies!  The puppies kept getting out until we found a way to prop up another board to close off the step-through and keep it in place with something heavy.

Perhaps the biggest drawback of all was when the litter outgrew the the whelping box and the time came to find a place to store it. And not only was it hard to find space for a 4ft x 4ft structure, even just moving the structure was a big job.  With the walls and floor both made of particle board, the structure was incredibly heavy.  The only real way to move it without disassembling (which was out of the question with how many screws were used along each edge...) was to put it on it's side, and "roll" it, as much as a square can roll.

As they say, with many challenges come many opportunities!
